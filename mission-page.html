                <p>Despite everyone’s best efforts, the internet as we know it is constantly under attack by hackers and other undesirable individuals. Information is attacked every single day, people post offensive or harmful content, and more. The integrity of the Internet as a whole is at risk of falling apart, and it’ll take everyone to defend it and themselves. Fortunately there are some fairly simple ways to go about doing just that.
                <br><br>
                Everyone can invest in antivirus software to help give their computers an extra level of security, since they can detect incoming threats and block them before anything bad happens. This instantly helps defend your valuable information from cybercriminals and hackers. However, there are some things that are out of our control, like if someone online decides to publicly post things online that attack people or groups of people. While we can’t stop this from happening, what we can do instead is spread awareness of what’s going on to gain support from the good people of the internet in order to strongly discourage the attackers or to get the managers of the site to take action against the offensive user.
