                    In recent years a very difficult question to answer has been raised: Is the Internet still a good thing, or has its purpose been twisted over time? Do we need to cut back on it? However, in my personal view, the bad side of the internet is incomparable to the overwhelming good that can come from it. Scary things might exist on the internet: hackers who can do almost anything from stealing information, identities, and more, but the internet has helped us out in a wide variety of ways. The Internet will always be a helpful force, no matter what. But to get a greater understanding of how we got here, it’s always important to look back and see where we started.

                    Sometime in the 70’s, two men created the first widely available model of the internet: Robert Kahn and Vinton Cerf. It took roughly a decade or so for it to be used by a big organization, and the internet finally became publicly accessible in 1990 when Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web. Like most inventions and technologies, the Internet was originally conceived during WWII when quick transfers of information were needed, but the groundwork wouldn’t be laid out until the early 60’s, when that war ended and another was already underway. Regardless, eventually the technology was completed and it successfully made instantaneous information sharing possible.

	                The internet’s gone a long way ever since it was publicly released 3 decades ago, and it really shows. People use it every day, and it has a wide variety of uses that are too great and many to even begin listing. People post their images, videos, and whatever they’re thinking on the Internet, people do their shopping via the Internet, they’re catching up on the latest news on the Internet, etc. It’s brought people together from all over the world since it’s easy for lots of people to come together over things they enjoy, and things might never be the same. People can communicate with each other on opposite ends of the Earth, it’s possible to do business with international accomplices, and groups of people have banded together and grown as a community. 
                    A world without the Internet is cutting out a chunk of people’s lives that is so big that you might as well be cutting the world in half. Removing such a big part of everyone’s daily lives is out of the question, and comparing everything that the Internet is to the group of cyber criminals that attempt to ruin people’s experience with it is like comparing the size of an ant to a blue whale. No amount of criminals could ever make erasing the Internet necessary, since the Internet is very large in scale. Hackers and cyber criminals just aren’t a big enough problem to need less Internet in the lives of the people of the world, so it’s better if we keep things exactly how they stand today.
